The clan of Lizardfolk that make their home high on the mesa known as Calamity Ridge are secretive, reclusive, and distrustful of hoppers. Though they would not use these terms, they are organized as an anarcho-syndicalist commune with no central government or leadership, and no organized economy. Indeed the very concept of property is somewhat alien to them, rendering your average hopper's overwhelming lust for riches even more baffling.
