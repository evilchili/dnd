Sand Striders are 6-legged giant lizards evolved to survive in the harsh magical climates of the Sahwat Desert. Despite their large size, standing nearly 5 feet at the shoulder and up to 10ft long from snout to tail, striders are quick, silent predators that move with ease on difficult terrain and resist the Desert's magical effects. While experienced hoppers quickly learn to stay well clear of the beasts, Lizardfolk tribes have been known to ride Sand Striders. Just how they are able to tame the great lizards is unknown.

There are numerous sub-species, each with its own distinct coloration and elemental affinity, which determines the type of damage done by their spit:

| Sub-Species | Damage Type |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Blue        | Lightning   |
| White       | Frost       |
| Red         | Fire        |
| Green       | Poison      |
| Black       | Acid        |
