### The Gaunt Traveler

##### 1. What is your secret reason for becoming an adventurer?

My secret is that I am FELURIUS MAGNUS MAGNUSSON PASHTUM, Magnus Stairwell, The Man Who Will Not Die.

I sent myself unknowingly into the past of Telisar to learn about Residium.

##### 2. Who have you wronged?

I sell high grade nitrogen fertilizer for gun powder and incendiaries.

My brand is FUNGUS MINERALS.

Minus a 'U', this is an anagram of Magnus Felurius.

The fertilizer bags' logo is a rainbow formed of the brand name, over a cartoon character.

The character is a smiling mushroom, giving a thumbs up of approval.

If you consider the rainbow an inverted 'U', his name is on every bag he sells.

Someone considers the sale of these materials a wrong.

##### 3. What would you kill to know?

I would kill to:
* know the fundamental secrets of how Residium works
* establish my hidden Myconid colony. (Know that my family is safe)
* keep the secrets of Residium for the colony. (Know that my future is assured)

##### 4. What do you fear?

I fear dying without understanding how Residium works.

##### Extra Credit Goals

###### Short-term

* find a safe place to reincarnate as a Myconid.
* secure the trust of folks to protect myself and the colony.

###### Medium-term

* found a new Myconid colony around the secrets of Residium crystals.

###### Long-term

* discover the secrets of the Residium waste and crystals.
* collect, protect, harvest and distribute Rresidium among an army of Myconids.
* found a distributed set of colonies.
* establish a store house of knowledge and equipment as a legacy for my future self, trusted travelers and companions.

### Evelina's Character

##### 1. What is your secret reason for becoming an adventurer?
- Was sent into exile after going against wishes of her tribe and saving an individual who then took advantage of the hospitality - causing harm to her tribe and perhaps even resulting in the death of some of her people.

##### 2. Who have you wronged
- Her own people, according to them. She is estranged from family for her choices to help “selfish” adventurers.
- Probably countless competing adventurers

##### 3. What would you kill to know
- How to restore the land and thus restore her people (she was raised in a “corrupted view” tribe)
- The location of the individual that wronged her and her people and led to her exile. But she isn’t entirely sure what she would do when/if she ever found them.

##### 4. What do you fear
- Losing those she has grown close to, which perhaps has hindered her getting too close to anyone in the past
- Losing herself (her physiology being tied to the land - she was raised with a belief that she is corrupted and can succumb further to her people’s “curse” and become more and more savage)

##### What are your short, medium, and long-term goals
**STG**: Surviving and making a difference in the way she best can. Getting stronger and finding ways to adapt and market her skills. Collecting cool things + tattoos of her exploits.

**MTG**: Finding a place to belong. Filling the void of connection with her tribe.

**LTG**: Restoring the land to the legacy of her ancestors, and in turn hopefully restoring her people.
