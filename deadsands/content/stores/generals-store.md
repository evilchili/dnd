The General's Store is a popular one-stop shop for Tano's Edge hoppers gearing up for that big desert score and
locals stocking their larder. The proprietor is an ancient, affable half-orc called The General, assisted by his
nephew Otis.

The general supply is well-stocked with basic adventuring gear and a healthy clientele keeps turnover of common
items high. The General has a reputation for being able to move just about anything, from random metal scraps to
gardening supplies to artifacts of historical interest.
