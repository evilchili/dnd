Andok is a cantankerous dwarf who specializes in nonmagical salves, potions, and reagants. He makes a killing
supplying hoppers who wisely avoid magical healing when in the desert, but is notorious for his quick, violent
temper and contempt for, well, pretty much everything and everyone. He remains stubbornly unaligned, but his wares
are so useful the Liberty Sisters don't dare chase him out of town.

"Andok's Elixirs" are reliable, if vile, substitutes for potions of healing, if you can afford them.
