Andok's is a cantankerous dwarf who specializes in nonmagical salves, potions,
and reagents. He makes a killing supplying hoppers who wisely avoid magical
healing when in the desert, but is notorious for his quick, violent temper and
contempt for, well, pretty much everything and everyone. He remains stubbornly
unaligned, but his wares are so useful the Liberty Sisters don't dare chase him
out of town.

"Andok's Elixirs" are reliable, if vile, substitutes for potions of healing, if you can afford them.
