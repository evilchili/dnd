The Blooming Wastes stretch out before you: a mostly flat expanse of hard,  cracked earth blanketed by some kind of sandy brown scrub. Small mesas dot the horizon, suggesting the possibility of shelter. As you approach you see that the scrub is covered in thick black thorns sharp enough to pierce boot leather; you will need to tread carefully.
