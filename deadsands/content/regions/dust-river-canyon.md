Dust River Canyon is a half-mile wide gash in the landscape, running forty miles southeast from the edge of the Blooming Wastes. A sheer, crumbling switchback leads to its base where thick clouds of red dust some 2 feet thick swirl, resisting all attempts to settle or disperse. Stalking predators move unseen within the dust, emerging from caves in the canyon walls.
