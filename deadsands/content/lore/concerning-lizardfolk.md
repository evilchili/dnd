Lizardfolk have a proud tradition of nomadic tribal life along the northeastern Sahwat. Within the last few hundred years the tribes have traveled close enough to Tano's Edge to first establish regular trade relations, and eventually immigrate into the cities. Today, Lizardfolk are somewhat rare but not unknown, particularly in Gazakh Noch, where a sizable population lives in the Scaletown neighbourhood.

The Lizardfolk cultural traditions are tightly interwoven with a deep spiritual connection to the land: they worship the Sahwat as a deity, and consider the nomadic travel of the tribes an eternal pilgrimage. Accordingly, a certain tension exists between nomadic Lizardfolk who keep to the old ways and those who have settled outside the desert proper.

### Scentspeak

Generations of life in the Sahwat has had its effects, and chief among them is *Scentspeak*, a Common name for the Lizardfolk language consisting of telepathic imagery combined with emotional information conveyed by pheramones expressed from scent glands at the base of the neck. Some examples:

| Emotion     | Smells Like... |
|-------------|----------------|
| Happy       | Ham            |
| Sad         | Lemons         |
| Angry       | Onions         |
| Scared      | Rotten Eggs    |
| Impressed   | Bacon          |
| Irritated   | Cabbage        |
| Serious     | Jasmine        |
| Bored       | Dirt           |
| Alarmed     | Burnt Toast    |
| Proud       | Cookies        |
| Ashamed     | Old Socks      |
| Curious     | Grass          |
| Reverential | Roasted Garlic |
| Disgusted   | Raw Garlic     |

Tiny variations and combinations of odors can be expressed to convey subtle distinctions; the more intense the odor, the more vivid the emotion. For example, a Lizardfolk releasing his sins to the sand may smell like a combination of ham and roasted garlic with an undercurrent of old socks.
