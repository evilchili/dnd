4 spans we travel from the moonlit door to the chambered stars. Seekers of Joy attend, and know our ways:

3 steps a day we spread, covering the stones

2 .... .o...t., 1 Ea..: 9 step.. we tak. ..f.re rest

1 North, 1 East, 1 North, East and East, Joy beckons

South and South and South, 

South and South again: Joy calls us downward and away

To the sunset we turn for 2 days more,

And 2 final days South we crawl; until the last 3 days at dawn

Bring us to the stars of morning, where sit we now in our Joy Unending

But we wonder what Joy exists beyond these walls of space and time

What holds us here?

What purpose a Joy contained, fettered and singular?
