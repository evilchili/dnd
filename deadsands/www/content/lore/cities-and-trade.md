Over the last several hundred years, a variety of folk have settled the northen rim of the Dewa Q'Asos, in the shadow of Hoard's Vault where temperatures are milder. A few larger city-states have risen, with several smaller communities along the trade routes. By far the largest is Gazakh Noch, a great city whose walls control the Gold Pass, effectively isolating the Dewa Q'Asos from the rest of the continent.

    * A fortified town in the northwest foothills of Hoard's Vault, Poshni Koth's wealth comes from its total monopoly on black powder production. Its laws forbid magic of any kind and its hardline politics discourage outsiders from establishing permanent residence.

    * Humans, Halfings, Dragonborn
    * Arcane research, enchantment
    * Until recently, Tano's Edge was little more than a remote village on a ridge overlooking the Sahwat desert, catering to outcasts and the lawless. But with the discovery of ruins under the sands and the riches they contain, this town has become a powder keg of competing interests.

    * A nomadic group of Scraps that travels between settlements with an enormous ambulatory junk pile.
