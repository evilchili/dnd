    summary: |
      The General's Store is a popular one-stop shop for Tano's Edge hoppers gearing up for that big desert score and
      locals stocking their larder. The proprietor is an ancient, affable half-orc called The General, assisted by his
      nephew Otis.

      The general supply is well-stocked with basic adventuring gear and a healthy clientele keeps turnover of common
      items high. The General has a reputation for being able to move just about anything, from random metal scraps to
      gardening supplies to artifacts of historical interest.
